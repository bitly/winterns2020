# 2020 Winternship Public API Explorer
For this winternship, we are building a proof of concept for a public API explorer. Users can interface with the different endpoints, or access information from them more easily without needing to run curl requests. 

## Gitpod Setup & Commits
1. Open a workspace in gitpod by going to `https://gitpod.io/github.com/bitly/winterns2020` or add the chrome extension (which adds the GitPod button to your Github account)
2. Create a new branch off of master `git checkout -b <YOUR BRANCH>`
3. Install flask through requirements.txt file, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make your changes
5. Commit changes to Github using the commands `git add <file names> `, `git commit -m {commit message}`, `git push --set-upstream origin <YOUR BRANCH>`.
6. On winterns2020 repo in Github, navigate to `branches`, find your branch, and click on the open pull request button. 

### To Run the Flask App
1. Make sure the virtual environment is activated and that you are in the directory with the `app.py` file
2. Run `flask run`
3. Click to port 500 through Gitpod, or preview in the sidebar.

### That's it! ðŸŽ‰
